## 📝 **SAMPLE QUESTIONS WITH FULL CONTENT**

### **🎯 Question 1: Mathematics**
```
📝 Question 1 of 10

What mathematical concept is used to find the rate of change of a function?

📄 Source: Mathematics_Fundamentals.pdf
📖 Context: Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change. 
Derivatives represent the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable, 
allowing us to analyze how quantities change over time.

🎯 Choose your answer:
A) Calculus and derivatives ✅
B) Algebraic equations
C) Geometric proofs
D) Statistical analysis

💡 Explanation: Calculus, specifically derivatives, is the mathematical tool 
used to find rates of change. This is fundamental in physics for velocity and 
acceleration, in economics for marginal analysis, and in engineering for optimization.
```

### **🎯 Question 6: Python Programming**
```
📝 Question 6 of 10

In Python programming, what data structure stores items in key-value pairs?

📄 Source: Python_Programming_Guide.pdf
📖 Context: A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs where 
each key is unique. It's defined using curly braces {} and allows fast lookup 
of values using their corresponding keys.

🎯 Choose your answer:
A) List
B) Tuple
C) Dictionary ✅
D) Set

💡 Explanation: Dictionaries are Python's implementation of hash tables or 
associative arrays. They provide O(1) average time complexity for lookups 
and are essential for mapping relationships between data.
```

### **🎯 Question 10: Biology**
```
📝 Question 10 of 20

What is the powerhouse of the cell in biology?

📄 Source: Biology_Fundamentals.pdf
📖 Context: Mitochondria are organelles found in most eukaryotic cells.
They generate most of the cell's ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through
cellular respiration, providing energy for cellular processes.

🎯 Choose your answer:
A) Nucleus
B) Ribosome
C) Mitochondria ✅
D) Endoplasmic Reticulum

💡 Explanation: Mitochondria are called the 'powerhouse of the cell' because
they produce ATP, the energy currency of cells. They have their own DNA and
are thought to have evolved from ancient bacteria.
```

### **🎯 Question 15: Chemistry**
```
📝 Question 15 of 20

What is the chemical formula for water?

📄 Source: Chemistry_Basic_Compounds.pdf
📖 Context: Water is a chemical compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms
bonded to one oxygen atom. Its molecular formula is H₂O, making it one of
the most important compounds for life.

🎯 Choose your answer:
A) H₂O ✅
B) CO₂
C) NaCl
D) CH₄

💡 Explanation: Water's chemical formula is H₂O, indicating two hydrogen
atoms and one oxygen atom. This simple molecule is essential for all known
forms of life on Earth.
```

### **🎯 Question 17: Astronomy**
```
📝 Question 17 of 20

What is the largest planet in our solar system?

📄 Source: Astronomy_Solar_System.pdf
📖 Context: Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a mass
greater than all other planets combined. It's a gas giant composed primarily
of hydrogen and helium.

🎯 Choose your answer:
A) Saturn
B) Jupiter ✅
C) Neptune
D) Earth

💡 Explanation: Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a
diameter of about 143,000 kilometers. It's so large that all other planets
could fit inside it with room to spare.
```

### **🎯 Question 20: Physics**
```
📝 Question 20 of 20

What is the speed of light in a vacuum?

📄 Source: Physics_Constants.pdf
📖 Context: The speed of light in a vacuum is a fundamental physical constant,
approximately 299,792,458 meters per second, which equals about 300,000
kilometers per second or 186,000 miles per second.

🎯 Choose your answer:
A) 300,000 km/s
B) 299,792,458 m/s
C) 186,000 miles/s
D) All of the above ✅

💡 Explanation: The speed of light in vacuum is exactly 299,792,458 m/s by
definition. This can also be expressed as approximately 300,000 km/s or
186,000 miles/s - all answers are correct representations.
